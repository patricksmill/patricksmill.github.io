A simple note taking application for Android, initially made for my Software Design class. Users can add notes and have them tagged for easy filtering and organization. This was my first time using source control and proved valuable, learning how to use git from both the terminal and inside IDEs.

While my work on the project is complete for the class, I have ideas for porting to iOS, adding features like cloud backups, etc. I think it would be a good learning experience to continually build on the project.
