    "text": "I’m passionate about technology, computer hardware and software. I enjoy building and experimenting with various tech projects, from creating Android applications to setting up self-hosted servers and exploring the world of Hackintosh systems.\nMy journey in technology spans multiple areas including mobile app development, system administration, and hardware troubleshooting. I believe in learning through hands-on experience and sharing knowledge with the community.\nWhen I’m not working on tech projects, you’ll find me playing baseball, which has been a lifelong passion of mine. I appreciate the strategic thinking and teamwork that both technology and sports require.\n\n\n\nEducation: Currently enrolled at Vassar College ’27, Graduate of Pennridge High School\nInterests: Mobile app development, system administration, hardware troubleshooting, self-hosted solutions\nCurrent Projects: Home server setup, Hackintosh builds, Android development\nSports: Baseball enthusiast\n\n\nPlease visit the About page for detailed information about my technical projects and professional experience."
