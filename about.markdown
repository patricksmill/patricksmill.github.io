### Graphic Design

### Software



#### AMDRyzenTosh

In the summer of 2024, I became interested in building my own [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh). I had not used MacOS since 3rd grade at my elementary school, and since then had used primarily Windows with the occassional linux distro attempted every other month. I was so interested that when it was time to upgrade my graphics card, I dropped the NVIDIA 1650 Super for an AMD RX 6600 for better compatability with MacOS, per the [Dortania OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). This guide can be a little overwhelming and is not completely up-to-date, but it is a good starting point for anyone wondering if it is even possible to Hackintosh their system.

Within 24 hours, I had a working MacOS Sonoma install on my desktop, dual booting with windows 11. I hand made my efi per the guidance of Dortania, so that I could learn the basic workings of OpenCore in case of troubleshooting (which there was). Currently, I use [OCAT](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools) in order to update the EFI in a less time-consuming manner.

After a few hours of tinkering around in this new (to me) MacOS world, one question remained in my mind: "What now?" I hadn't put much thought into what I would actually **do** with it. Gaming was pretty quickly ruled out.

**Skills learned/practiced:**

* EFI bootloader configuration and troubleshooting
* Understanding of OpenCore and Hackintosh architecture
* Dual-boot setup and partition management
* Problem-solving and research using forums and guides
* Patience and persistence in debugging hardware/software compatibility
* Using tools like OCAT for EFI management
* Documentation and sharing solutions with the community

#### Home Server

I built my first computer during the pandemic in 2020. Since then, I have gradually been upgrading it one part at a time until, like the ship of Theseus, it is comprised of new replacement parts. This left me with an entire PC's worth of old parts. My summer project since coming home from school has been building a Family home server that serves as a media device.

The server runs on CasaOS on top of Ubuntu Server, and utilizes several Docker containers:

* For family photos, I use Immich, a self-hosted Google Photos alternative.
* I ripped our old DVDs using MakeMKV and organized them using Radarr for movies and Sonarr for TV Shows
* Plex Media Server streams these backups to devices on the network, serving as a Self-hosted Netflix

**Skills learned/practiced:**

* Linux server administration (Ubuntu Server)
* Docker
* Network configuration and port management
* Media file organization and metadata management
* Storage management and file system organization
* Troubleshooting hardware compatibility issues
* Backup and data recovery strategies
* Web-UI administration interfaces
* Network File Sharing (SMB)

## Education
