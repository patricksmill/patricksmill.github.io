I'm passionate about technology, computer hardware and software. I enjoy building and experimenting with various tech projects, from creating Android applications to setting up self-hosted servers and exploring the world of Hackintosh systems.

My journey in technology spans multiple areas including mobile app development, system administration, and hardware troubleshooting. I believe in learning through hands-on experience and sharing knowledge with the community.

When I'm not working on tech projects, you'll find me playing baseball, which has been a lifelong passion of mine. I appreciate the strategic thinking and teamwork that both technology and sports require.
