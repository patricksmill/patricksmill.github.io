                    <p>A simple note taking application for android, initially made for my Software Design class. Users can add notes and have them tagged for easy filtering and organization. This was my first time using source control and proved valuable, learning how to use git from both the terminal and inside IDEs.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm going to continue working on QuickNotes after submitting it for my class. I have ideas for porting to iOS, adding features like cloud backups, etc.</p>

                    <h4>AMDRyzenTosh</h4>
                    <p>In the summer of 2024, I became interested in building my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh">Hackintosh</a>. I had not used MacOS since 3rd grade at my elementary school, and since then had used primarily Windows with the occassional linux distro attempted every other month. I was so interested that when it was time to upgrade my graphics card, I dropped the NVIDIA 1650 Super for an AMD RX 6600 for better compatability with MacOS, per the <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/">Dortania OpenCore Guide</a>. This guide can be a little overwhelming and is not completely up-to-date, but it is a good starting point for anyone wondering if it is even possible to Hackintosh their system.</p>
                    
                    <p>Within 24 hours, I had a working MacOS Sonoma install on my desktop, dual booting with windows 11. I hand made my efi per the guidance of Dortania, so that I could learn the basic workings of OpenCore in case of troubleshooting (which there was). Currently, I use <a href="https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools">OCAT</a> in order to update the EFI in a less time-consuming manner.</p>

                    <h4>Home Server</h4>
                    <p>I built my first computer during the pandemic in 2020. Since then, I have gradually been upgrading it one part at a time until, like the ship of Theseus, it is comprised of new replacement parts. This left me with an entire PC's worth of old parts. My summer project since coming home from school has been building a Family home server that serves as a media device.</p>
                    
                    <p>The server runs on CasaOS on top of Ubuntu Server, and utilizes serveral Docker containers:</p>

                        <li>For family photos, I use Immich, a self-hosted Google Photos alternative.</li>
                        <li>I ripped our old DVDs using MakeMKV and organized them using Radarr for movies and Sonarr for TV Shows</li>
                        <li>Plex Media Server streams these backups to devices on the network, serving as a Self-hosted Netflix</li>
