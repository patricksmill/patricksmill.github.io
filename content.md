    In the summer of 2024, I became interested in building my own [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh). I had not used MacOS since 3rd grade at my elementary school, and since then had used primarily Windows with the occassional linux distro attempted every other month. I was so interested that when it was time to upgrade my graphics card, I dropped the NVIDIA 1650 Super for an AMD RX 6600 for better compatability with MacOS, per the [Dortania OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). This guide can be a little overwhelming and is not completely up-to-date, but it is a good starting point for anyone wondering if it is even possible to Hackintosh their system.

    Within 24 hours, I had a working MacOS Sonoma install on my desktop, dual booting with windows 11. I hand made my efi per the guidance of Dortania, so that I could learn the basic workings of OpenCore in case of troubleshooting (which there was). Currently, I use [OCAT](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools) in order to update the EFI in a less time-consuming manner.
